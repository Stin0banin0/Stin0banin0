#Saffran is the name of a programming language I wanna come up with and hopefully once make. The file extension would be .sf if available. It's largely based off of Python and a few other languages I've seen such as C++/C#, Smalltalk, Java, and Minecraft commands;

#Sf uses the print() ;
print('')

#;

#String statements in Sf are as follows:

a in b #True if the list/lib/tuple/... or if string a contains string b in one piece

#Number statements in Sf are as follows:

a==b #True if a is equal to b;
a>b #True if a is larger than b, equal to b<a;
a>=b #True if a is equal to or larger than b, equal to b=<a;
!{a==b} #True unless a is equal to b;
{}

#Verbal operators:

a y b #True if a and b are both True
a o b #True if at least a or b is True
no a #True if a is False
