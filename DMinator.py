#You add a character with a library. The current system will only feature a max of eight characters. Because I'm still experimenting, I will have to put the highest speed character on the first character.
#You add a character with this format: char<charNumber>={"name":"<character name>","health":<>,"attackDType":<what type of die>,"attackDN":<how many of said die>}

#Next, you need to add enemies. These enemies are formatted the same as the characters, but as enemy<enemyNumber>

#First make a def for a battle, then add more abilities, and then armour and dodge

def battle():
    print("placeholder")

#Here I'll add the characters and enemies for testing so I won't have to fill that stuff in again every time

char1={"name":"Theo","health":100,"attackDType":6,"attackDN":3}
