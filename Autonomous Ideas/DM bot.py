The idea of this li'l thing is that it's gonna use data from a bunch of people to hopefully be able to create fun DnD stories. 
I don't know if it's gonna work, but you never know, and if you don't hope, you're never gonna know. 

Now, what I'm currently thinking of is making some different things. 
First thing is some scenarios. I might just do very short games about small, short scenarios with friends to see their reactions to the situations.

Example (- is DM,| is player):
-You're in a prison cell. WDYD?
|I look around  #Here lookAround is an action
-The room is small, about 3x4m. There is a small barred window. All walls are made of stone bricks, and one, opposite the window, has a wooden, lined with iron, door in it.
    In the room there also is a wooden bed and toilet in the form of a hole in the ground. 
|I try the window bars to see if they're by any chance loose
-They're firmly in place
|I knock on the wooden door
-At first, nothing happens, but suddenly you start hearing footsteps coming down the hall in your direction. A small window in the door is opened and you see a guard's face through
    it
|I tell the guard that I'm sick and do my best impression of a sick person
-The guard enters the room
|I hit the guard in his face as soon as they come around the door, and use the moment of ruckus to escape and lock him in the cell
Etc. etc.
